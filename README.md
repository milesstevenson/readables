# Readables

This is a content and comment web app, given as an end project to work on for Udacity's Redux course. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

The entire frontend of this project was built from scratch, however the backend API Server has been included by Udacity to build on top of.

## Deploy Locally

    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, install dependencies and start the Create React App server for the frontend

    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
